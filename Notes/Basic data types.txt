Basic data types:

1)const:     we can't change the value of the constant variable after assigning the first time
const a=10;                                                    const a=95; 
a=97;                                                          d=50;                      //You can assign the value to the other variable but not the constant variable
//This program gives the error                                // No error here

2)back tic | Interpolation operator |
var b=`used to add the variable in the string and use his value instead of his string like $(age)`;
var age="10"
console.log(b);
OUTPUT is:
used to add the variable in the string and use his value instead of his string like 10.

3)hoisting
console.log("First statement",x);
console.log("Second statement");
console.log("Third statement");
console.log("Fourth statement");
var x=10;
console.log("Fifth statement");
console.log("Sixth statement");
console.log("Seventh statement");

output:
First statement undefined
Second statement
Third statement
Fourth statement
Fifth statement
Sixth statement
Seventh statement
